# Understanding AI: Supervised Learning and CNN Applications

This repository contains solutions to two exercises as part of the Understanding AI module.

## Exercise 1: Car Sales Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Predict the price of second-hand cars using regression models and explore clustering techniques.
- **Dataset**: `car_sales_data.csv`
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Compare regression models using single and multiple features.
  - Analyze the impact of categorical variables on price prediction.
  - Develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
  - Apply k-Means clustering and compare with other algorithms.

## Exercise 2: Flower Species Classification
- **Objective**: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify flower species from photographs.
- **Dataset**: [TensorFlow Flowers Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers)
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Design and justify CNN architecture.
  - Implement regularization techniques.
  - Tune hyperparameters for optimization.
  - Evaluate performance and mitigate overfitting.

## Files in Repository
- `Exercise 1-Car Sales.ipynb`: Analysis and predictions for car sales data.
